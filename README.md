# ASC AiiDA tutorials
In-house Atomistic Simulations Centre tutorials - Introduction to AiiDA.

We will focus on the very basics of AiiDA - how it works and what it can do. A comparison with Bash is also presented.
We will cover:

- submitting jobs (bash and AiiDA)
- parsing calculation results (bash and AiiDA)
- workflows in AiiDA
- AiiDA WorkFunctions
- AiiDA WorkChains

After completing these tutorials, the student will be prepared to understand the existing WorkChains provided by the various AiiDA plugins and use them for their own research. Examples and tutorials on each WorkChain of each plugin are available in the AiiDA documentation.
